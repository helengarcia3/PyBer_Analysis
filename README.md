# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Pyber Analysis

In this analysis we will be using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to summarize the ridesharing data set by city type the creating multiple-line graph to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type. We will be comparing how the the data differs by city type and and helping make recommendations to decision makers at PyBer.

## Results

The first image is  the summary for the ride data set grouped by they type of city the rides are taken. It is obvious that Urban cities have the most riders, drivers, and total fares and the rural citites have the least amount. 
  Drivers in Rural cities make more on average than drivers in Urban and suburban areas. This may be because there are more riders than there are drivers which can increase the demand and increase the prices in the rides. The rides in urban areas are most likely shorter distances than the rides in rural and suburban areas.

### Deliverable 2
The line graph below shows a visual representation of the total ride fares for January 2019 to April 2019. The graph shows that Urban cities made the most in fares and Rural cities made the least over all. The graph is pretty consistent in the trends month over month, each city type stayed within a $1,000 range of fares within the 4 months.

## Recommendations

In order to address disparities among the city types I recommend that:

 1. More data avaiable to analyze so we can see a full year of data points to better make decision.
 2. More drivers should be added to the rural cities because the average fare per driver is $55 while the one in urban cities is $17. Adding more drivers would make this less of a gap.
 3. The ride data should include the distance of the rides so we can get a better idea of the the fre per milage and add that as a point of comparison in our analysis.
